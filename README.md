# Berries App

This is a simple product management app built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TypeScript**.

## Features

- View, and filter berries
- Searching berries by name

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oapanova/berries.git
cd berries
````

### 2. Install dependencies

Since `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` are not included, install all required packages with:

```bash
npm install
```

This will recreate the node_modules folder and lock file.

### 3. Run the app locally
Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app on http://localhost:3000 (or another port if 3000 is in use).

### 4. Build for production (optional)
To build the app for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

To preview the production build:
```bash
npm run preview
```
